    "### Handling Exceptions in Python\n",
    "- In software development, different types of errors can occur. They could be syntax errors, logical errors, or runtime errors. \n",
    "- Syntax errors most probably occur during the initial development phase and are a result of incorrect syntax. Syntax errors can be caught easily when the program is compiled for execution.\n",
    "- Logical errors, on the other hand, are a result of improper logical implementation. An example would be a program accessing a unsorted list assuming it to be sorted. Logical errors are the most difficult ones to track.\n",
    "- Runtime errors are the most interesting errors which occur, if we don't consider all the corner cases. An example would be trying to access a non-existent file. "
